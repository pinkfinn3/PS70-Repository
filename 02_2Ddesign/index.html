<h4>Assignment 1: Box!</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>
<h5>Box V1: Pretty but useless</h5>
<p class="margin">   </p>



<p class="margin">   </p>
<div class="flexrow">
  <img src="./box1.JPG" alt="picture of a small box with holes" width = 300>
</div>
<p class="caption">This box neither conceals nor contains.</p>


There is nothing better than an object that fails to complete the only function 
it is meant to perform. The first interesting command we learned in fusion360 was the 
pattern function. I used it to make a box that cannot hold anything. First,
I designed a small one-piece box based on a sketch I made on a post-it note (not pictured;
it is in the trash). I then drew a diamond, multiplied it, multiplied it again, and finally,
multiplied it again 5 more times. My biggest challenge was fitment; it is not clear in this photo, but the box is not perfectly even, and the sides with fitting teeth have panel gaps, 
while the folded sides are tight. Because of this, I decided to make my next box out of individual pieces.  


<p class="margin">   </p>
<h5>Box V2: Bigger is Better </h5>
<p class="margin">   </p>


<p class="margin">   </p>
<div class="flexrow">
  <img src="./box2.JPG" alt="bigger box" width = 500>
</div>
<p class="caption">Box V2: Go big or go home. </p>

Not only did I make version 2 bigger, but this one has an engraving, yo! Wow, this box  is incredible. 
The teeth may be too long, making them overhang, and the sides may have been measured incorrectly, leading to a 2mm gap on every other corner (see below), requiring discreet hot glue sealant, and I may have ignored kurf entirely because I was  busy watching True Detective: Season 3, necessitating the addition of even more hot glue, but hey, WHAT A BOX!

<div class="flexrow">
  <img src="./box3.JPG" width = 400 alt="NOT several small cardboard tiles on a laptop computer">
</div>
<p class="caption">Fitment issue</p>

I was tempted to make a third version, and I may yet. But I also have a real job, play guitar in two bands, and I'm starting a business, so you'll just have to wait. While I was winding up the laser cutter for round 3, one of my wise class members said "you're too young to be such a perfectionist, don't you have other work to do?" While I was disappinted that the young patch of stubble covering my chin - like a virgin putting green at a Long Island golf course - didn't trick her into believing I was a full adult, the advice was sound. So I took it easy. I am metamorphasizing into a self care king, and nothing's going to stop me.

<h4>Assignment 2: Fusion 360 Tutorial</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>
My  goal for 3D printing and molding and casting is to recreate and update my favorite accessory, a pair of Prada sunglasses I found on the ground at the Harvard-Yale pregame. If you or a friend lost a pair of sunglasses at Harvard-Yale 2023, I bought my sunglasses like everyone else, with money, and I didn not find them on the ground. I used the Fusion360 tutorial assignment to get a head start on the sunglasses project. I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxjOADM1TmE" target="_blank">YouTube tutorial</a> on modeling sunglasses and learned how to make sunglasses bands. This is what I learned how to do: 
<p class="margin">   </p>
<div> 1. Insert an image to outline with a sketch.
<div> 2. Use the fillets tool to round the edges of my model.
<div> 3. Emboss my brand name with the text and emboss features.

<h4>Assignment 3: Fusion Modeling</h4>

<h5>Model 1: USB Adapter</h5>
<p class="margin">   </p>
<div class="flexrow">
  <img src="./USB1.jpeg" alt="a CAD model of a flash drive sitting on top of five CAD-modeled metal nuts.">
</div>
<p class="caption">Model 1: USB A-C Adapter</p>

The first item I modeled was the humble USB A to C adapter; A staple of our lives since Apple cruelly stripped the world of usable laptop ports, this object is a poetic masterpiece. Tiny, but critical for the modern engineer. It sports a beautifully simple design but its very existence makes basic information transfer more complex than it was 10 years ago.

<div class="flexrow">
  <img src="./USB large.jpeg" width = 700 alt="a dialog box showing the parameter dimensions of the flash drive.">
</div>
<p class="caption">The sketch and measurements of my adapter.</p>


I started by sketching the drive and taking measurements with a caliper. Then, I modeled it in CAD. It was not very difficult and it could have been modeled in more detail, but this was my warm up. The next object was a wild journey of Fusion360 learning.

</div>
<p class="caption">Final Product</p>

This exercise began as an educational session in CAD development but transformed into a journey of self reflection. Why is technological progress so frustrating? How many generations of cable adapters must we purchase just to perform basic tasks? Why do we - the consumers - suffer for the prideful squabbles of major corporations over standards of use?  Why must today's students - the next generation of creators and the most likely population to end climate change - waste our precious time competing over a limited supply of tiny adapters because Tech bigwigs refuse to overcome their differences and agree on a common hole?

<h5>Model 2: Tide Pen Cap</h5>

I recreated the suspiciously intricate cap of my tide pen. I bought my tide pen to get stains out of my favorite white hoodie, but little did I know it would one day give me a master-class in the "revolve" feature in Fusion360. 


<p class="margin">   </p>
After sketching the cap on paper and taking measurements with the calipers, I came up with a basic plan for the 3d model. First, I would create the basic skeleton out of two cylinders. Then I was going to figure out the rest. 
<p class="margin">   </p>
<div class="flexrow">
  <img src="./cap.jpg" width = 400 alt="the same nut, with a physical nut held up in front of it.">
</div>
<p class="caption">Sketch.</p>
</p>
I can extrude cylinders all day, so I knew that part would be easy. But the neat slant between them was going to be a challenge. Thus, my first step was a study in making cones. I figured if I could make a cone, then I could potentially cut it out with extrusions or resize it to fit within my cylinders. After a quick google search, I realized the "revolve" function was exactly what I needed, and I played around with it. I learned that you can pick the axis around which you revolve, meaning you don't just have to make a cone--you can also make donut-shaped objects, which was exactly what I needed.

</div>
<p class="caption">Study in cone.</p>
</p>
</p>
After solving the revolve problem, my next task was the ribs. First, I made a long rectangle on the Y plane and extruded in two directions. I then tried using the circular pattern command, but I realized the Y plane was the wrong place to build my patter. So I tried again, making my rectangles on the X plane, expanting that into an 8-object circular pattern, and extruding the rectangles 18mm downwards into the lower cylinder. Finally, I hollowed out the inside.

<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>


<p class="margin">   </p>
<h4>Primary Idea: Busy Button/Spend the Night Light</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>
For my final project, I plan to make the "Spend the Night Light". Every year, dozens of university students complain that there is no high-tech evolution of the sock on the door. Whether you're on an important Zoom call or engaging in a spirited game of horizontal tango, your privacy is important. 

Our solution is simple; create an ergonomic switch that attaches to your bed, side table, or desk. Once flipped, our app sends a notification to a group of your choosing that you are BUSY. The switch is also wirelessly connected to an LED reciever which can be placed outside your room. Depending on switch position, this light will display one of two colors, signifying "don't come in" or "enter cautiously".</p>

<p class="margin">   </p>
Ideally, I would create a mechanical keypad with a matching interface that would
allow me to assign and reassign the keys to various macros or other command
sequences. This would involve a programmable interface housed in an enclosure
with several mechanical keys and two or more encoder wheels. If possible, it
would be cool if the keypad were wireless via Bluetooth or a similar protocol.
And in an ambitious world, the keypad would also be able to switch between
multiple profiles so that I could use it for everyday work in addition
to lighting.

/ The main issue here is it rests atop a laptop and gets power via USB. The other options are similar. This does not allow for you to control an external light from your desk/bed. My device will be A) wireless and B) self-powered.

<h4>Idea: Bluetooth Speaker with Timer</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>
I often like to listen to a noise generator or music as I fall asleep. The noise
generator app I use has a built-in timer functionality that pauses playback after
a set amount of time to prevent it from playing all night, but Spotify (which I
use for music) does not. I'm not sure how feasible it would be, but I would like
to build a device that could play music from my phone and automatically pause it
after a certain amount of time.

<p class="margin">   </p>
I would love for this to be a physical speaker with a built-in display screen and
some buttons, where I could access all the normal music playback functions
(play/pause, volume up/down, skip forward/backward) as well as controls for starting
and stopping a custom-length timer to pause playback. Additionally, it would be cool
if the device could slowly fade out the music over a period of time as another
option besides a hard pause.

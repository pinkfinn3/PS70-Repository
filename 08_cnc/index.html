<h4>Assignment: Make Something With CNC</h4>

This week, I was dealing with a lot of tiny parts for my final project and needed somewhere to keep them. During the CNC demo, Nathan pulled out a box of end mills. I wasn't so interested in the hardware as I was with the box itself; extremely simple but satisfying and compact.
 </p>
 I remade the box in Cad and asked for help operating the CNC machine. The wood I chose was pretty terrible, and it seemed to desintegrate as it was being cut.

  To make up for the ugliness, I spent some time on the belt sander to round the endges and clean up the splinters.

I was also working on my final project and realized the box fit my ESP32 perfectly, so it made a good temporary control box for SpendTheNight Light.

The primary project this week was my sunglasses. I've been working on these since 3D design week and we are about 75% to completion.

At first, I was running into odd behavior when defining toolpaths for the shape
in Aspire, but eventually, with the help of the TAs, I managed to figure out
that I had forgotten to close one of the vector paths. Once I fixed that, I was
able to define all the tool paths in Aspire and cut out the parts on the ShopBot.
The cutting bit was far scarier than I was anticipating!

I found my favorite pair of sunglasses on the ground at Harvard-Yale and they make me powerful. The bands are heavy and geometric; they scream "excess". I wear them when I'm driving, but they kill my peripheral vision and I have to crank my head like an owl to make sure I don't plow into someone when I change lanes.

So began a long arduous journey in CAD. The mission? Recreate the glasses and add "windows" reminiscent of the McLaren Senna  to improve visibility. Simple, right?

    <h3>Here's what I would tell my past self:</h3>
    <p class="margin"></p>
</p>
Sunglasses have two main parts: band and frame. Both bend along 3 axes. this means simple extrusion and cutting won't do. Find another solution.
</p>
Your first plan, scanning the glasses and then "just cutting a hole" will be an utter failure, although it makes a good shark fin!

Printing tiny plastic hinges is unreliable. Harvest the hinges from an old pair of glasses and adapt the fitment in your model. 

It is crucial to import canvases on both x and y axes to model from an image.

Offset planes are your best friend. First, use these to create 6 sketches along the y axis to estimate the geometry of the frame from the top view.
</p>
Next, after sketches and intense visualization in your head, draw lines from which to create offest planes at the odd angles where your frames and bands are cut. 
</p>

</p>
You won't be able to recreate the geometry perfectly. I'm still not  sure how some of the angles work on the real glasses.

The craftsmanship is incredible. Some of the traingles are not flat planes as they seem, but bent surfaces disguized as planes to make the bands look like a series of flat triangles.
</p>
Your first attempt is the wrong size. 
</p>
</p>

</p>
So far, you've been making offset planes by drawing perpendicular lines, drawing a rectangle, and extruding that rectangle. This is much less efficient than the offset plane function. Stop doing that (I will continue to do this anyway later on).
</p>
Your second attempt is a little bit better, but you forgot to bend the frames. Thankfully, a heat gun will probably be fine.

<p class="margin">   </p>
When you go back to edit your first attempt, you will have created so many sketches and bodies that you'll have to start from scratch  to make a small edit.
</p>
Even after hours of modeling, you still won't be completely sure how you're going to fit lenses in these glasses. 
</p>
</p>

</p>
You create a last-minute lip on the inside of the frames in hopes that this will allow the lenses to sit flush. Still unclear whether this strategy will pay off. 
</p>
You will test your scrap lenses to see whether they can be shaped with a heat gun. They can... kind of. 
</p>
You will learn to create lofts and intersect a front-face sketch with 5 successive sketches on offset layers on the y axis to account for the 3-axis geometry of the frame.

    <h3>And it gets better.</h3>
    <p class="margin"></p>
After 6 hours modeling the frame, you'll remember that there are more cuts you forgot to make. Thankfully, they're only the second most complex. You'll spend another 45 minutes trying to understand from which direction you need to extrude your triangles to cut the frame, and you'll remember that you already mirrored the body, so you have to do everything twice, mirroring again.

Your first 3 attempts printing the almost-final sample will crash and you'll spend 2 days in the lab trying to 
</p>
Insecurity will build as you look to a nearby table and realize in the time it took you to inch your way through a YouTube tutorial on lofts in Fusion360, your friend who has never used CAD created a custom printed DSLR Sony A7 3-lens attachment harvested from instant cameras. 
</p>
Ever since taking apart your favorite glasses, they haven't quite fit right, and you worry you ruined them for this project.

    <h3>But there's good news too!</h3>
    <p class="margin"></p>
You become less insecure when your friend admits his design failed and he had to copy one online.
</p>
Despite committing to get to bed at 11:30pm, you spend another hour trying to create components so you can combine your frame and bands in a single STL. Meanwhile, it's started to pour rain and the Dhall closed
</p>
Fast forward a day, you'll go into the lab again and crash 3 prints over 2.5 hours before your design finally prints correctly. 
</p>
Print supports screw up flat surfaces, so flip your designs in Prusa to ensure the fronts are facing upwards.
